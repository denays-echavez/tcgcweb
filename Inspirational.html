    <h2>Iglesia Ni Cristo</h2>
    <p>This photo shows me and my family at our church, Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), during the church anniversary celebration. We gathered not only to celebrate the anniversary, but also to thank God for His guidance and blessings. Being together in church strengthens our faith, reminds us of our values, and teaches us unity, love, and obedience to God. This moment is special because it reflects our commitment to serving God as a family and living according to the teachings of the Church.</p>

    <h2>SHS Graduation</h2>
    <p>This photo shows me with my family on my Senior High School graduation day. With God’s guidance and strength, I was able to finish SHS despite the challenges along the way. My family stood by me, supporting and encouraging me, while trusting in God’s plans for my future. This moment reminds me that through faith, perseverance, and God’s blessings, goals can be achieved. It reflects the values of gratitude, hard work, and trust in God that guide my life.</p>
